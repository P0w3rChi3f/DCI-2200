# Module 1: CPT Overview

## Course Description

* All DCI activities revolve around one central theme: identifying and communicating pre-existing or developing adversary activity in a mission commanderâ€™s network.  
* DCI analysts also are tasked with rapid deployment of indicators of compromise to detect, defend and ultimately eradicate enemy freedom of action in friendly networks.  
* This course introduces the concepts of threat agents, threats, IOCs, sensors and remediation techniques for use in DCI activities.

## Course Objectives

* Summarize the CPT mission
* Integrate threat intelligence analysis with mission owner requirements
* Choose appropriate tools and techniques for network and host reconnaissance and collection
* Analyze host and network data to identify indicators of compromise (IOCs)
* Create remediation strategies and mitigation plans of action
* Compile final reporting and perform other mission closeout activities

## Course Layout and Expectations  

* Students will be introduced to tools and provided resources for the tools that they will be using throughout the course
* Students are encouraged to ask instructors for clarification whenever necessary
* Students should collaborate with each other via the Moodle Discussion Board(s)
* Students must complete and submit their Operator Logs, both for exercises and exams
* DCI is an exercise-based course allowing for students to work collaboratively in a close approximation of a real-world environment
* Students will be tasked with performing DCI-specific duties in different real-world scenarios and so may not always be given a complete picture at the start of the exercise
* Each exercise will be followed by an instructor debrief to further emphasize processes and methodologies that students can implement in their roles
* Exercises can be repeated up to 10 times to allow students to further refine their capabilities
