The first week we surveyed the land and verified the network map provided. We also verified the baseline of the host machines.  We also prepared our equipment by formating our drives and running some test scripts to make sure they worked.  

Once on the ground we executed our sensor placement plan and moved into the survey stage where we took our scripts, equipment, and other tools and started looking for evil.  We did end up fining several pieces of malicious items.  We found executables that were downloaded from the internet.  Some of them obtained persistence by setting the HKLM and HKCU run keys to execute the malware.  We found an image that was using steganography and was hiding a base64 encoded password.  We also did some log analysis and looked at the various logon types.

When we had a handle on all the IoC's we moved into the secure stage.  While in this stage we continued to Identify Data Exfil, Deploy GRR, Identify Beacons, investigated some Possible Phish attempts and both true and false-positive events.
