## Exercise 5.1-03: Select Appropriate Courses of Action to Mitigate Threats

### Case Study 03-01

[Mitigation Strategies](Documents/Mitigation_Strategies_2017_Details_0.pdf)  
[Mitigation Table](Documents/Ex5.1-06-Mitigation-Table.xlsx)  

[Mimikatz](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0002/)  
[Pass the Hash](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/002/)  
[Poison Ivy: Assessing Damage and Extracting Intelligence](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/poison-ivy-assessing-damage-and-extracting-intelligence)  
[ASD - Mitigation Details](https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/publications/strategies-mitigate-cyber-security-incidents-mitigation-details)  

1. I would deploy a HIPS/HIDS solution to help prevent/detect Poison Ivy and User Training.  The malware gets onto the system through social engineering.  Once on the system, it starts the default web browser in the background and injects itself into that process.  Chances are the browser will be whitelisted and connections to the internet will look legit, so web filtering is out. Training the users not to receive things from strangers and backing that up with the HIDS/HIPS technology seems to be the better route.  

2. The report gives us a list of IPs and Domains to black list.  Starting with this information we could implement web content filtering.  We could also add a proxy and force all web traffic through it, making it harder for the C2.  

3. We could use a Web Content filter here to detect data leaving our network.  We could set up some fake data (canaries) to alert us that data exfiltration was attempted.

4. I will have to go with User Training on this one.  There are so many ways mimikatz can be delivered that we need to turn our users into human sensors.

5. I would restrict admin privileges.  limiting these permissions and only using these permissions as needed will limit the number of passwords, hashes, cache, etc that it will collect.  

6. I would deploy an OS generic exploit mitigation to help protect the memory where the hashes are located.  

7. Same a question 5.   Stop admins from logging in and only running applications as admin when necessary.  

### Case Study 03-02  

1. It can still be recommended.  
2. We could recommend OS generic exploit mitigation instead, it has an upfront cost of low.  
3. We would need to find a different solution, maybe like using the host based firewall to filter traffic  

### Case Study 03-03  

1. Using the documents, I would opt to re-installing the OS  
2. I would need to locate the dll and remove it, or re-install the OS.  
3. I would probably refer to the business continuity plan and force a password reset enterprise-wide.
4. Identify the correct order of operation and provide your rationale
    * Verify installed programs - this will help with validating services and network traffic
    * Verify service list - should match up with OS and Installed programs
    * Run packet capture - to help identify unknown processess and see if they are reaching out to the internet
    * Kill active processes - Most applicatons will need to be inactive before removal
    * Remove abnormalities - Finally remove the abnormality
